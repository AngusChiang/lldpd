`lldpd` supports several OS. You can install it from packages or from
sources. Once installed, you may want to look
[how to use and configure it]([[usage.html]]).

[TOC]

# GNU/Linux

## Debian and Ubuntu

`lldpd` is already available in Debian and Ubuntu. You can install it
with:

    ::console
    $ sudo apt-get install lldpd
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree       
    Reading state information... Done
    The following extra packages will be installed:
    [...]

It will be installed and configured to start at boot. You can change
the options of `lldpd` in `/etc/default/lldpd`.

If the package is not recent enough, you can use the
[Debian backports][] on Debian. Follow the instructions available on
the website.

If it is still not recent enough, you can grab the appropriate Debian
package from [openSUSE Build Service][]. Follow the instructions
available on the website.

The last option is to to [build _lldpd_ from source][]. You can still
install and uninstall the package to get `_lldpd` user and group, as
well as a working init script.

## Gentoo

`lldpd` is available in portage. Just issue the command `emerge lldpd`
to install it. You can also [build _lldpd_ from source][].

## Fedora, RHEL, CentOS & SUSE

You can install the packages from [openSUSE Build Service][]. Follow
the instructions available on the website. Once installed, you can
change the options provided to `lldpd` in `/etc/sysconfig/lldpd`.

It is also possible to [build _lldpd_ from source][].

# BSD

`lldpd` is currently available in the ports tree of most BSDs[^ports].
Follow the instructions on how to install lldpd from ports by following
the documentation specific to the respective ports tree.

Some BSDs provide up-to-date binary packages using their respective
package management tools.

Though if you want to [build _lldpd_ from source][]. You can add
`_lldpd` user with `vipw` and add `_lldpd` group by adding it manually
in `/etc/group`. The user must not be able to login, have its home as
`/var/empty` and a disabled shell (like `/bin/false`).

[^ports]: It has been added to the ports tree of OpenBSD (net/lldpd),
          FreeBSD (net-mgmt/lldpd) and NetBSD's pkgsrc (net/lldpd).
          DragonFly uses the FreeBSD port with an overlay named DeltaPorts.

You may want to configure `lldpd` with
`--with-privsep-chroot=/var/empty` to avoid to create
`/var/run/lldpd`.

If `lldpcli` is not able to provide completion, you can use the `help`
command instead or install the GNU Readline library on your system.

# Mac OS X

The easiest way is to use the
[installer package for OS X][lastpkg]. You need at least Mac
OS X 10.6.

Alternatively, you can use [Homebrew][]. Check the website if you
don't have it, it is easy to install. Once installed, type in a
terminal:

    ::console
    $ brew install https://raw.github.com/vincentbernat/lldpd/master/osx/lldpd.rb
    ######################################################################## 100.0%
    ==> Downloading https://media.luffy.cx/files/lldpd/lldpd-{{ resource.meta.latestversion }}.tar.gz
    ==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/lldpd/{{ resource.meta.latestversion }} --with-xml --with-readline
    [...]

Pay attention at the instructions at the end of the build: they
explain how to create `_lldpd` user and group and how to run `lldpd`
when the system starts.

At least, you can [build _lldpd_ from source][].

# Install from source

This is the last resort method. Other methods are usually simpler.

You first need to download the latest version
([{{ resource.meta.latestversion }}][lasttgz]). You need a working build
environment.

    ::console
    $ tar zxvf ~/download/lldpd-{{ resource.meta.latestversion }}.tar.gz
    $ cd lldpd-{{ resource.meta.latestversion }}
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
    checking whether build environment is sane... yes
    checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /bin/mkdir -p
    checking for gawk... gawk
    [...]
    ------------------ Summary ------------------
     lldpd version {{ meta.resource.latestversion }}

      LLDPMED........: yes
      DOT1...........: yes
      DOT3...........: yes
      XML output.....: no
    ---------------------------------------------

    Check the above options and compile with:
     make

If this steps fail, feel free to [file a bug report][]. The content
of `config.log` should be helpful. Otherwise, check if everything is
as you except and continue.

    ::console
    $ make
      CC     strlcpy.lo
      CCLD   libcompat.la
      CC     log.lo
    [...]
    make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/bernat/src/lldpd-{{ resource.meta.latestversion }}'

If this steps fail, feel free to [file a bug report][] too with the
output and some details on your platform. The `config.log` is also
useful in this case.

You can finish the installation with `make install`. Then, you still
have to complete the following steps by yourself. They are system
specifics:

 - Ensure the `liblldpctl` library is correctly registered with the
   system. The output of `make install` should give the appropriate
   steps. On Linux, this is `ldconfig -a`.
 - Create a `_lldpd` user and a `_lldpd` group. This is needed for
   privilege seperation (increased security).
 - Create the chroot (`/usr/local/var/run/lldpd` by default). It is just an
   empty directory.
 - Ensure that `lldpd` is started at boot.

`../configure` accepts several options. You can get them with
`../configure --help`. The most interesting ones are `--with-snmp` and
`--with-xml`.
